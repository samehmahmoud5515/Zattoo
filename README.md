# Zattoo

Aritecture used: VIPER with Rx-Swift 

I used this clean aritecture which makes the every layer separated and testable.

I implemented all the requiremnts for iOS target only. I tried to do my best to follow Zattoo app design language.

I used reactive extensions for player in oreder to make every part follows reactive programming.

You can find in this screen shot the bitrate and current playback position (at the right side) for every channel. Besides you can change player ratio aspect.

Zattoo task also supporting orientaion (landscape & portrait)

Also I did implment the stream setting module which you can change subtitle, audio and quality.
